Publishing Books Android App 
============================

Technology
----------

* This is Cordova application that uses Jquery Mobile and Sqlite to display and search
book contents.
    * Cordova enabled me to do multi-platform development with minimum hassle.
    * JQUeryMobile is really a nice framework that enables me to reuse the GUI code on the web if I need.
    * Sqlite is distributed with Andorid and iPhone, so it is good data store with full text indexing; hint: the 
    sqlite FTS does not support ranking results out of the box. 
     
* It uses PyCharm IDE, however, it is not needed at all.
    * You can use whatever IDE, I used and liked the command line interface of cordova,
    see shell files under ./sonna/ folder.
